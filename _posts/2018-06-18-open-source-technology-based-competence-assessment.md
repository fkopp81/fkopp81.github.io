## Give a researcher a test and they'll test for a study. Give them a testing software and they'll...

Sharing competence assessment items endangers the psychometric validity. They could leak to the broader public, including study participants. That "burns" the instrument, as the effect of knowing the particular item gets intertwined with the true skill of a person.

Contrast that to sharing the software used to administer the instrument. When the items are clearly seperated, participants hardly can be influenced if they come in contact with the software itself. On the other hand there is a number of advantages associated in free sharing:
- Paying forward: You support new researchers interested in technology based assessment, when they can build on your groundwork.
- Transparency: You document the technical properties of your tests - others can re-implement your tests with mock items and reproduce the experience of your test takers.
- Collaboration: By sharing the software code, others can contribute to it, from finding bugs, improving your written documentation, or adding new features. Using a public repository like Github, you retain control over the development of your "brand" of the software.
- Networking: You will attract people that are interested in what you share. And those are just the people you want to get in touch with to exchange knowledge and explore research opportunities.

## Open source

"Open source" is the keyword for freely sharing software. The rote requirement for that is, that you do publically share your software and its code publically, as licence it in a way that allows others to freely use and modify the software as they wish. Such a licence usually includes a clause to indemnify you as far as legally possible.

There are many established open source licenses out there. A common one is the [MIT-licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License):

> Copyright (c) \<year\> \<copyright holders\>

> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.

### Copyleft

One caveat in the open source world are so called "copyleft" licenses. These include a clause requiring all derivates of the work to be put under the same licence.

For software used as a foundation of instruments that include confidential items such a clause would be highly problematic, because you might end up requiring yourself to release your items after all.

The MIT licence does not include such a copyleft-clause.
