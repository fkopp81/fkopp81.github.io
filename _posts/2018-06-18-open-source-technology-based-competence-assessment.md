## Give a researcher an instrument and they'll test for a study. Give them a testing software and they'll...

Sharing items from competence tests with others comes with caveats. They could leak to the broader public and some test takers might get to know them, thus psychometrically "burning" the test.

Sharing the technology used to administer the items is a whole other story. As long as the actual item contents are clearly seperated, test takers hardly can be influenced if they come in contact with the software itself. On the other hand there is a number of advantages associated in free sharing:
- Paying forward: Researchers interested in TBT (technology based testing) can get started easier when they can build on your groundwork.
- Transparency: You document the technical properties of your tests - interested researchers can implement your tests with mock items and reproduce the experience of your test takers.
- Collaboration: By sharing the code itself, you give others the chance to contribute to it in a number of ways, from finding bugs, improving your written documentation, or adding new features.
- Networking: You will attract people that are interested in what you share. And those are just the people you want to get in touch with. 

## Open source

"Open source" is the keyword for freely sharing software. The rote requirement for that is, that you do publically share your software and its code publically, as well as put it under a licence that allows others to freely use and modify the software as they wish, while including a clause to indemnify you as far as legally possible.

There are many established open source licenses out there. A common one is the MIT-licence:

Copyright (c) <year <copyright holders

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal

copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR

AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.

### Copyleft

One caveat in the open source world are so called "copyleft" licenses. These include a clause requiring all derivates of the work to be put under the same licence.

For software used as a foundation of instruments that include confidential items such a clause would be highly problematic, because you might end up requiring yourself to release your items after all.

The MIT licence does not include such a copyleft-clause.
