title: Totally meta - what makes this blog tick.

## Ack!

This blog is already succeeding in nomming away at my time. And I just wanted to quickly write about something totally different.

Anyways, I think I have now found a setup that is somewhat convenient for this blog:
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the backend
- Using the [Jekyll Clean Dark](https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark)
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
- Using [Prose.io web](https://prose.io) for editing from the web (ugh, they default to http unless you specify https!)
- And [Teddy Hyde](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.EditorHyde.app&hl=en) to add and edit posts from my phone

So yeah, this is my setup. I put more time than I am comfortable mentioning making it, so feel free to clone it from my [github repo](https://github.com/fkopp81/fkopp81.github.io), if you want to make your own. Just make sure to clear out my posts, okay?
